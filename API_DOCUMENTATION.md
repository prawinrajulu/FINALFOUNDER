## 📝 MIGRATION NOTES

### Auto-Migration on Startup:
On first backend startup after deployment, the system will:
1. Check if migration marker exists in `system_config`
2. If not, create department folders from existing student data
3. Create year folders under each department
4. Assign all existing students to appropriate folders
5. Mark migration as complete

**Migration is idempotent** - safe to run multiple times.
