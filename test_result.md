# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"

## test_plan:
##   current_focus:
##     - "Task name 1"
##     - "Task name 2"

##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

  System redesign for Campus Lost & Found Management System to fix logical errors:
  A. Authentication - Landing page with only Student/Admin login (no public lobby before auth)
  B. Admin Students - Department + Year context switch before viewing/uploading
  C. Core Semantics - Claims ONLY for FOUND items, "I Found This" for LOST items
  D. AI Advisory Only - Confidence bands (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH) instead of percentages
  E. Admin Accountability - Mandatory reason for claim decisions
  F. Image Optional - Allow text-only item reports

          ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED: AIClaimChat expected itemId as prop but route passes it as URL param.
          FIX APPLIED:
          1. Added useParams() to extract itemId from URL
          2. Added useEffect to validate item exists and is FOUND type before allowing claim
          3. Added loading/error states for unavailable items
          4. Added item preview card showing what's being claimed
          5. Pre-submission validation checks item_id is present
          6. Better error handling with redirect on 404

      MAJOR SYSTEM REDESIGN IMPLEMENTED:
      
      1. AUTHENTICATION/NAVIGATION:
         - New LandingPage.js with only Student Login and Admin Login buttons
         - No public browsing before login
         - Lobby (/lobby) now requires authentication
         - Role badge shows in header after login
      
      2. SEMANTIC FIX - Claims vs Found Responses:
         - Claims are ONLY for FOUND items (ownership verification)
         - LOST items get "I Found This" button (new FoundResponsePage.js)
         - Backend validates item_type before accepting claims
      
      3. AI ADVISORY ONLY:
         - Returns confidence_band (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH) instead of percentage
         - Shows inconsistencies if detected
         - Clear disclaimer that AI doesn't make decisions
      
      4. ADMIN ACCOUNTABILITY:
         - Reason is MANDATORY for claim approve/reject (min 10 chars)
         - Audit logs include reason and admin info
      
      5. IMAGE OPTIONAL:
         - Can report items without images
         - Description validation (min 20 chars)
      
      6. RATE LIMITING:
         - Max 5 claims per day per user
         - Max 3 found-responses per day per user
      
      TEST LOGIN CREDENTIALS:
      - Student: roll_number + DOB (DD-MM-YYYY)
      - Admin: superadmin / SuperAdmin@123
      
      Please test the backend endpoints first, focusing on:
      1. GET /api/health - should work without auth
      2. GET /api/lobby/items - should require auth
      3. POST /api/items/{id}/found-response - for LOST items only
      4. POST /api/claims - should reject if item is LOST
      5. POST /api/claims/{id}/decision - should require reason

      BUG FIX: AI Claim "Item not found" error
      
      ROOT CAUSE: AIClaimChat component expected itemId as a prop ({ itemId, onClose }) 
      but when used as a route element (<Route path="claim/:itemId" element={<AIClaimChat />} />),
      it receives itemId via URL params, not props. Result: itemId was undefined.
      
      FIX APPLIED to /app/frontend/src/components/AIClaimChat.js:
      1. Changed from prop-based to useParams() extraction: const { itemId } = useParams()
      2. Added useEffect to validate item exists on mount
      3. Added check that item is FOUND type (not LOST)
      4. Added check that item is not already claimed/returned/archived
      5. Added loading state while validating
      6. Added error state with clear message if item unavailable
      7. Added item preview card showing what's being claimed
      8. Pre-submission validation ensures itemId is present
      9. Better error handling with automatic redirect on 404
      
      BACKEND VERIFIED: Claim endpoint works correctly when given valid item_id
      Created test FOUND item: 3918d7ab-280a-4460-9b50-a5feb163d9e6
      Successfully submitted claim: 871d4838-5321-4fb6-bccb-4217c4abded8
      
      PLEASE TEST FRONTEND:
      1. Login as student (112723205047 / 23-04-2006)
      2. Go to Lobby (/lobby)
      3. Find a FOUND item and click "Claim This Item"
      4. Verify item preview shows at top
      5. Complete the claim form
      6. Submit and verify no "Item not found" error

      COMPREHENSIVE TEST RESULTS:
      ✅ Health Check (No Auth) - Works without authentication
      ✅ Lobby Authentication - Correctly requires auth (403 without token, 200 with token)
      ✅ Semantic Claims Validation - Perfect implementation:
         • Claims REJECT LOST items with clear error message
         • Claims work for FOUND items (with proper ownership validation)
      ✅ Found Response Validation - Perfect implementation:
         • Found responses work for LOST items only
         • Found responses REJECT FOUND items with clear error message
      ✅ Admin Accountability - Fully enforced:
         • Missing reason field returns validation error
         • Short reason (<10 chars) rejected with proper message
         • Proper reason (>=10 chars) validation works correctly
      ✅ Context-based Student Management - Working correctly
      ✅ Item Creation - Works without images (optional image feature)
      ✅ Rate Limiting - Implementation verified in code
      
      CRITICAL SEMANTIC FIXES VERIFIED:
      1. Claims are ONLY for FOUND items ✅
      2. "I Found This" responses are ONLY for LOST items ✅
      3. Admin decisions require mandatory reason (min 10 chars) ✅
      4. Lobby requires authentication ✅
      5. Health check works without auth ✅
      
      ALL HIGH-PRIORITY BACKEND REQUIREMENTS SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENTED AND TESTED.
      
      The redesigned Campus Lost & Found backend API is working perfectly with all semantic fixes in place.
