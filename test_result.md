# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

  System redesign for Campus Lost & Found Management System to fix logical errors:
  A. Authentication - Landing page with only Student/Admin login (no public lobby before auth)
  B. Admin Students - Department + Year context switch before viewing/uploading
  C. Core Semantics - Claims ONLY for FOUND items, "I Found This" for LOST items
  D. AI Advisory Only - Confidence bands (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH) instead of percentages
  E. Admin Accountability - Mandatory reason for claim decisions
  F. Image Optional - Allow text-only item reports

          ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED: AIClaimChat expected itemId as prop but route passes it as URL param.
          FIX APPLIED:
          1. Added useParams() to extract itemId from URL
          2. Added useEffect to validate item exists and is FOUND type before allowing claim
          3. Added loading/error states for unavailable items
          4. Added item preview card showing what's being claimed
          5. Pre-submission validation checks item_id is present
          6. Better error handling with redirect on 404

          ✅ CRITICAL BUG FIX VERIFIED - AI CLAIM FLOW WORKING CORRECTLY:
          
          COMPREHENSIVE TEST RESULTS:
          1. Landing Page ✅ - Loads correctly with Student/Admin login options
          2. Student Authentication ✅ - Login works with roll number 112723205047 / DOB 23-04-2006
          3. Common Lobby Access ✅ - Requires authentication, loads successfully after login
          4. FOUND Items Display ✅ - Items with "Claim This Item" buttons visible
          5. AI Claim Navigation ✅ - Successfully navigates to /student/claim/{itemId} URL
          6. NO "Item not found" Error ✅ - The critical bug is FIXED
          7. Item Preview Card ✅ - Shows "Claiming This Item:" with item details
          8. AI Student Care Assistant ✅ - Interface loads properly
          9. Multi-step Form ✅ - All 6 steps can be completed (product type, description, marks, location, date, proof)
          10. Error State Handling ✅ - Invalid item IDs show proper "Cannot Submit Claim" error
          
          ROOT CAUSE FIX CONFIRMED:
          - useParams() properly extracts itemId from URL (was undefined before)
          - Item validation works correctly on component mount
          - Pre-submission validation prevents submission without valid itemId
          - Error states are handled gracefully with user-friendly messages
          
          The "Item not found" error that users were experiencing is completely resolved.
          AI claim submissions now work end-to-end without the critical error.

          AI SYSTEM AUDIT - COMPREHENSIVE FIXES APPLIED:
          
          BACKEND (server.py):
          1. Added INSUFFICIENT confidence band for weak evidence
          2. Added assess_input_quality() function to penalize vague inputs
          3. Check item status before AI analysis (reject archived/returned)
          4. Include has_proof_image flag in AI context
          5. Include secret_message in AI analysis (partial, for comparison hints)
          6. Comprehensive AI system prompt with:
             - Explicit rules that AI is ADVISORY ONLY
             - Definition of each confidence band
             - Generic terms to penalize
             - Specific evidence to value
          7. Structured AI output with:
             - what_matched
             - what_partially_matched  
             - what_did_not_match
             - missing_information
             - inconsistencies
             - recommendation_for_admin
          8. Safe fallback returns INSUFFICIENT (not LOW) when AI fails
          
          FRONTEND (AIClaimChat.js):
          1. Display all match categories
          2. Show input quality flags
          3. Show missing information
          4. INSUFFICIENT band styling
          
          FRONTEND (AdminClaims.js):
          1. Full AI analysis breakdown for admin
          2. Color-coded match sections
          3. Admin recommendation display

      MAJOR SYSTEM REDESIGN IMPLEMENTED:
      
      1. AUTHENTICATION/NAVIGATION:
         - New LandingPage.js with only Student Login and Admin Login buttons
         - No public browsing before login
         - Lobby (/lobby) now requires authentication
         - Role badge shows in header after login
      
      2. SEMANTIC FIX - Claims vs Found Responses:
         - Claims are ONLY for FOUND items (ownership verification)
         - LOST items get "I Found This" button (new FoundResponsePage.js)
         - Backend validates item_type before accepting claims
      
      3. AI ADVISORY ONLY:
         - Returns confidence_band (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH) instead of percentage
         - Shows inconsistencies if detected
         - Clear disclaimer that AI doesn't make decisions
      
      4. ADMIN ACCOUNTABILITY:
         - Reason is MANDATORY for claim approve/reject (min 10 chars)
         - Audit logs include reason and admin info
      
      5. IMAGE OPTIONAL:
         - Can report items without images
         - Description validation (min 20 chars)
      
      6. RATE LIMITING:
         - Max 5 claims per day per user
         - Max 3 found-responses per day per user
      
      TEST LOGIN CREDENTIALS:
      - Student: roll_number + DOB (DD-MM-YYYY)
      - Admin: superadmin / SuperAdmin@123
      
      Please test the backend endpoints first, focusing on:
      1. GET /api/health - should work without auth
      2. GET /api/lobby/items - should require auth
      3. POST /api/items/{id}/found-response - for LOST items only
      4. POST /api/claims - should reject if item is LOST
      5. POST /api/claims/{id}/decision - should require reason

      BUG FIX: AI Claim "Item not found" error
      
      ROOT CAUSE: AIClaimChat component expected itemId as a prop ({ itemId, onClose }) 
      but when used as a route element (<Route path="claim/:itemId" element={<AIClaimChat />} />),
      it receives itemId via URL params, not props. Result: itemId was undefined.
      
      FIX APPLIED to /app/frontend/src/components/AIClaimChat.js:
      1. Changed from prop-based to useParams() extraction: const { itemId } = useParams()
      2. Added useEffect to validate item exists on mount
      3. Added check that item is FOUND type (not LOST)
      4. Added check that item is not already claimed/returned/archived
      5. Added loading state while validating
      6. Added error state with clear message if item unavailable
      7. Added item preview card showing what's being claimed
      8. Pre-submission validation ensures itemId is present
      9. Better error handling with automatic redirect on 404
      
      BACKEND VERIFIED: Claim endpoint works correctly when given valid item_id
      Created test FOUND item: 3918d7ab-280a-4460-9b50-a5feb163d9e6
      Successfully submitted claim: 871d4838-5321-4fb6-bccb-4217c4abded8
      
      PLEASE TEST FRONTEND:
      1. Login as student (112723205047 / 23-04-2006)
      2. Go to Lobby (/lobby)
      3. Find a FOUND item and click "Claim This Item"
      4. Verify item preview shows at top
      5. Complete the claim form
      6. Submit and verify no "Item not found" error

      🎉 FRONTEND AI CLAIM FLOW BUG FIX VERIFIED - CRITICAL ISSUE RESOLVED!
      
      COMPREHENSIVE FRONTEND TESTING RESULTS:
      
      ✅ CRITICAL BUG FIXED: "Item not found" error completely resolved
      ✅ Landing Page: Loads correctly with Student/Admin login options only
      ✅ Student Authentication: Works with credentials (112723205047 / 23-04-2006)
      ✅ Lobby Authentication: Requires login, redirects unauthenticated users
      ✅ FOUND Items Display: Shows items with "Claim This Item" buttons
      ✅ AI Claim Navigation: Successfully navigates to /student/claim/{itemId}
      ✅ Item Preview Card: Displays "Claiming This Item:" with item details
      ✅ AI Student Care Assistant: Interface loads properly
      ✅ Multi-step Form: All 6 steps work (product type, description, marks, location, date, proof)
      ✅ Error Handling: Invalid item IDs show proper "Cannot Submit Claim" error
      
      ROOT CAUSE FIX CONFIRMED:
      - useParams() now properly extracts itemId from URL (was undefined before)
      - Item validation works correctly on component mount
      - Pre-submission validation prevents submission without valid itemId
      - Error states handled gracefully with user-friendly messages
      
      TESTED SCENARIOS:
      1. Valid claim flow: Works end-to-end without "Item not found" error
      2. Invalid item ID: Shows proper error message
      3. Missing item ID: Handles gracefully
      4. Authentication flow: Works correctly throughout
      
      The critical "Item not found" bug that was blocking users from submitting AI claims is now completely resolved. Users can successfully complete the entire AI claim flow without encountering this error.

      🎉 AI CLAIM VERIFICATION SYSTEM TESTING COMPLETE - COMPREHENSIVE AUDIT VERIFIED!
      
      COMPREHENSIVE AI VERIFICATION TEST RESULTS:
      
      ✅ CRITICAL AUDIT FIXES VERIFIED:
      1. INSUFFICIENT confidence band exists and is properly used for weak evidence
      2. AI returns structured analysis with all required fields:
         - confidence_band (INSUFFICIENT/LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH)
         - what_matched (array)
         - what_did_not_match (array) 
         - missing_information (array)
         - advisory_note (string)
         - input_quality_flags (array)
      3. AI is truly ADVISORY ONLY - no status changes by AI (claims remain 'pending')
      4. Input quality assessment penalizes vague descriptions with quality flags
      5. AI failure returns INSUFFICIENT (not LOW) when LLM unavailable
      6. Claims are ONLY for FOUND items (semantic validation working)
      
      ✅ TESTED SCENARIOS SUCCESSFULLY:
      - Created FOUND item as Sam with detailed description and secret message
      - AI claim with detailed description works and returns structured analysis
      - AI fallback behavior works correctly when LLM integration unavailable
      - Confidence band system properly implemented (INSUFFICIENT used for weak evidence)
      - Input quality flags present and working
      - Advisory nature maintained (no automatic status changes)
      
      ✅ BACKEND API ENDPOINTS TESTED:
      - POST /api/items (FOUND item creation) ✅
      - POST /api/claims/ai-powered (AI claim submission) ✅
      - GET /api/claims/{id} (claim details with AI analysis) ✅
      - Authentication endpoints ✅
      
      🔍 AUDIT COMPLIANCE VERIFIED:
      The AI claim verification system has been comprehensively audited and all requested fixes are working correctly:
      
      1. ✅ INSUFFICIENT confidence band exists for weak evidence cases
      2. ✅ Input quality assessment penalizes vague descriptions  
      3. ✅ AI returns structured analysis with required fields
      4. ✅ Item status check prevents claims on archived/returned items
      5. ✅ AI failure returns INSUFFICIENT (safe fallback)
      6. ✅ AI is purely advisory - no automatic status changes
      
      SYSTEM STATUS: All AI verification audit fixes are working correctly. The system properly handles both LLM-available and LLM-unavailable scenarios with appropriate fallback behavior.
      
      TEST CREDENTIALS VERIFIED:

      A. CLAIM VISIBILITY & ELIGIBILITY FIX
         - Added `is_owner` flag to /api/items/public endpoint
         - ItemCard.js now checks ownership and hides claim buttons for owners
         - Shows "You reported this item" badge for item owners
         - Backend returns ownership info for each item
         Files: server.py, ItemCard.js
      
      B. ADMIN → STUDENT MESSAGE SEEN LOGIC
         - AdminMessages.js now shows exact `seen_at` timestamp
         - Format: "Seen • MMM d, h:mm a" when message is read
         - "Not Seen" displayed when message hasn't been viewed
         Files: AdminMessages.js
      
      PHASE 2 - MAJOR CHANGES:
      1. REMOVED COMMON LOBBY COMPLETELY
         - Deleted reference to PublicPage from App.js
         - Replaced /lobby route with /feed (Campus Feed)
         Files: App.js, AdminSidebar.js, StudentNav.js
      
      2. NEW MODULE: CAMPUS NOTICE & APPRECIATION FEED
         - Created CampusFeed.js with full social media-style feed

      3. FIX AI MATCHING PERCENTAGE (ALWAYS 0% BUG)
         - CRITICAL FIX: Query used status="active" but items stored with "reported"
         - Fixed query: {"status": {"$in": ["reported", "active", "found_reported"]}}
         - Added fallback algorithmic matching when AI unavailable
         - Uses category, description, location, date similarity scoring
         Files: server.py
      
      4. CLAIM REQUEST UI FIX
         - Mandatory reason for approve/reject decisions
         - Better error handling
         Files: AdminClaimRequests.js
      
      5. STUDENT PROFILE LOGOUT
         - Added logout button in StudentProfilePage.js
         - Clears session and redirects to login
         Files: StudentProfilePage.js
      
      READY FOR TESTING:
      - Campus Feed (create post as admin, like/comment as student)
      - AI Matching (should now show non-zero percentages)
      - Claim visibility (owner should see badge, not claim button)
      - Message seen timestamps
      - Student logout
